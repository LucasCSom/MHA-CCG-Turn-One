	/*
	 * Alright here's the plan
	 * Need to track foundations tap state and allow player to tap to pay
	 * Need to track Ready Set Go's state so is it in hand?
	 * Need to track whether the player wants to use it?
	 * Can it pass the check with character untapped?
	 * Eventually track new training method
	 * draw extra card going second
	 * have 1-3 mana floating going second
	 * 
	 * This is going to require its own function so i can manipulate the flow better and be able to order things differently
